        <h1>Instruction pipelining</h1>
        <p id = "paragraph_1" >In computer engineering, instruction pipelining is a technique for implementing instruction-level
            parallelism within a single processor. Pipelining attempts to keep every part of the processor busy with some instruction 
            by dividing incoming instructions into a series of sequential steps (the eponymous "pipeline") performed by different 
            processor units with different parts of instructions processed in parallel.</p>

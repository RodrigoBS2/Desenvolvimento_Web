        <h1>Instruction pipelining</h1>
        <p class = "paragraph_1" >In computer engineering, instruction pipelining is a technique for implementing instruction-level
            parallelism within a single processor. Pipelining attempts to keep every part of the processor busy with some instruction 
            by dividing incoming instructions into a series of sequential steps (the eponymous "pipeline") performed by different 
            processor units with different parts of instructions processed in parallel.</p>
        <br> 

        <h1>Concept and motivation</h1>
        <p class = "paragraph_2">In a pipelined computer, instructions flow through the central processing unit (CPU) in stages. For example, it might have one 
            stage for each step of the von Neumann cycle: Fetch the instruction, fetch the operands, do the instruction, write the results. 
            A pipelined computer usually has "pipeline registers" after each stage. These store information from the instruction and 
            calculations so that the logic gates of the next stage can do the next step.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Number of steps</h1>
        <div class = "paragraph_3">
            <p>The number of dependent steps varies with the machine architecture. For example:</p>
            <ul >
                <li>The 1956â€“61 IBM Stretch project proposed the terms Fetch, Decode, and Execute that have become common</li>
                <li>The classic RISC pipeline comprises:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Instruction fetch</li>
                        <li>Instruction decode and register fetch</li>
                        <li>Execute</li>
                        <li>Memory access</li>
                        <li>Register write back</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>The Atmel AVR and the PIC microcontroller each have a two-stage pipeline.</li>
                <li>Many designs include pipelines as long as 7, 10 and even 20 stages (as in the Intel Pentium 4).</li>
            </ul>

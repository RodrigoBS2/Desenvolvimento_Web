                A CubeSat is a class of <a target="_blank" href="Small_satellite.html" >miniaturized</a> satellite with a form factor of 
                10 cm (3.9 in) cubes. CubeSats have a mass of no more than 2 kg 
                (4.4 lb) per unit, and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 
                components for their electronics and structure. CubeSats are put 
                into orbit by deployers on the International Space Station, or 
                launched as secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. As of 
                August 2021, more than 1,600 CubeSats have been launched.

                Professors <mark>Puig-Suari</mark> of California Polytechnic State University
                and Bob Twiggs of Stanford University proposed the CubeSat reference 
                design in 1999: with the aim of enabling graduate students 
                to design, build, test and operate in space a spacecraft with capabilities 
                similar to that of the first spacecraft, Sputnik. The CubeSat, as initially 
                proposed, did not set out to become a standard; rather, it became a standard 
                over time by a process of emergence. The first CubeSats launched in June 2003 
                on a Russian Eurockot, and approximately 75 CubeSats had entered orbit by 2012.

                A <b>small satellite</b>, <b>miniaturized satellite</b>, or <b>smallsat</b> 
                is a satellite of low mass and size, usually under 1,200 kg (2,600 lb). While 
                all such satellites can be referred to as "small", different classifications 
                are used to categorize them based on mass. Satellites can be built small to 
                reduce the large economic cost of launch vehicles and the costs associated 
                with construction. Miniature satellites, especially in large numbers, may 
                be more useful than fewer, larger ones for some purposes â€“ for example, 
                gathering of scientific data and radio relay. Technical challenges in the 
                construction of small satellites may include the lack of sufficient power 
                storage or of room for a propulsion system.

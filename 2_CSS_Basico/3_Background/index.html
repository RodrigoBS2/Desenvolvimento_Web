        <h2>About</h2>
        <p id="p1">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an 
            application layer protocol in the Internet protocol 
            suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia 
            information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data 
            communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext 
            documents include hyperlinks to other resources that 
            the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click 
            or by tapping the screen in a web browser.</p>
        <p id="p2">
            Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at 
            CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing 
            the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP 
            version, named 0.9. That version was subsequently developed, 
            eventually becoming the public 1.0.

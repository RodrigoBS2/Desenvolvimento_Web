        <h1>Instruction pipelining</h1>
        <p class = "paragraph_1" >In computer engineering, instruction pipelining is a technique for implementing instruction-level
            parallelism within a single processor. Pipelining attempts to keep every part of the processor busy with some instruction 
            by dividing incoming instructions into a series of sequential steps (the eponymous "pipeline") performed by different 
            processor units with different parts of instructions processed in parallel.</p>

        <h1>Concept and motivation</h1>
        <p class = "paragraph_2">In a pipelined computer, instructions flow through the central processing unit (CPU) in stages. For example, it might have one 
            stage for each step of the von Neumann cycle: Fetch the instruction, fetch the operands, do the instruction, write the results. 
            A pipelined computer usually has "pipeline registers" after each stage. These store information from the instruction and 
            calculations so that the logic gates of the next stage can do the next step.</p>

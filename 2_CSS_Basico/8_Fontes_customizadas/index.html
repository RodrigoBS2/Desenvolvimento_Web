        <h1>Virtual Function in C++</h1>
        <p class = "paragraph_1" >A virtual function (also known as virtual methods) is a member function that is declared within a base class and is re-defined 
            (overridden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual 
            function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the method.</p>
        <br> 
        <ul>
            <li>Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for the function call.</li>
            <li>They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism.</li>
            <li>Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in a base class.</li>
            <li>The resolving of a function call is done at runtime.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Rules for Virtual Functions</h1>
        <div class = "paragraph_2">
            <p>The rules for the virtual functions in C++ are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Virtual functions cannot be static.</li>
                <li>A virtual function can be a friend function of another class.</li>
                <li>Virtual functions should be accessed using a pointer or reference 
                    of base class type to achieve runtime polymorphism.</li>
                <li>The prototype of virtual functions should be the same in the base 
                    as well as the derived class.</li>
                <li>They are always defined in the base class and overridden in a derived class. 
                    It is not mandatory for the derived class to override (or re-define the virtual 
                    function), in that case, the base class version of the function is used.</li>
                <li>A class may have a virtual destructor but it cannot have a virtual constructor.</li>
            </ol>
